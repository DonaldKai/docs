Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
#  Set up the EDB repository
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list

#  Replace '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' below with
#  your username and password for the EDB repositories:
echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <USERNAME> password <PASSWORD>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf

#  Add support for secure APT repositories:
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

#  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
#  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

# If there is `libmysqlclient-dev` already installed on your system, remove it by using the following command:
apt-get remove  libmysqlclient-dev

# Enable the MySQL repo:
# For MySQL 8:
echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-8.0" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
# For MySQL 5:
echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-5.7" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list

# Add the mysql repo key using the following commands:
apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5072E1F5

# Update the repository metadata:
apt-get update
```

## Install the package

```shell
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 13 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as13-mysql8-fdw`.
