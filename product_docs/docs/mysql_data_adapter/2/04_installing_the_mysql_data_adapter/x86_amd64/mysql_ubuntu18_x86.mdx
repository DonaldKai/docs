## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # If there is `libmysqlclient-dev` already installed on your system,
  # remove it by using the following command:
  sudo apt-get remove  libmysqlclient-dev

  # Enable the MySQL repo:
  # For MySQL 8:
  sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-8.0" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
  # For MySQL 5:
  sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-5.7" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 13 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as13-mysql8-fdw`.
