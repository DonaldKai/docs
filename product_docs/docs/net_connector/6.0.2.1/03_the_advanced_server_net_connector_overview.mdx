The EDB .NET Connector is a .NET data provider that allows a client application to connect to a database stored on an EDB Postgres Advanced Server host. The .NET Connector accesses the data directly, allowing the client application optimal performance, a broad spectrum of functionality, and access to EDB Postgres Advanced Server features.

The .NET Connector supports the following frameworks:

-   .NET 6.0
-   .NET 5.0
-   .NET Core 3.1
-   .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1


## The .NET class hierarchy

The .NET class hierarchy contains classes that you can use to create objects that control a connection to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database and manipulate the data stored on the server. The following are just a few of the most commonly used object classes.

`EDBConnection`

 The `EDBConnection` class represents a connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. An `EDBConnection` object contains a `ConnectionString` that instructs the .NET client how to connect to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

`EDBCommand`

 An `EDBCommand` object contains an SQL command that the client executes against EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Before you can execute an `EDBCommand` object, you must link it to an `EDBConnection` object.

`EDBDataReader`

 An `EDBDataReader` object provides a way to read an EDB Postgres Advanced Server result set. You can use an `EDBDataReader` object to step through one row at a time, forward only.

`EDBDataAdapter`

 An `EDBDataAdapter` object links a result set to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. You can modify values and use the `EDBDataAdapter` class to update the data stored in an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.
