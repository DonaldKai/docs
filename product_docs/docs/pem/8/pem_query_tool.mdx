PEM contains a feature-rich Interactive Development Environment (IDE) that allows you to issue ad-hoc SQL queries against Postgres servers.

You can access the Query Tool via the **Query Tool** menu option on the **Tools** menu, or through the context menu of select nodes of the Browser tree control. The Query Tool allows you to:

-   Issue ad-hoc SQL queries.
-   Execute arbitrary SQL commands.
-   Edit the result set of a SELECT query if it is [updatable](pem_online_help/08_toc_pem_developer_tools/02_query_tool/#updatable-result-set).
-   Displays current connection and transaction status as configured by the user.
-   Save the data displayed in the output panel to a CSV file.
-   Review the execution plan of a SQL statement in either a text, a graphical format or a table format (similar to <https://explain.depesz.com>).
-   View analytical information about a SQL statement.

You can open multiple copies of the Query tool in individual tabs simultaneously. To close a copy of the Query tool, select the **X** in the upper-right hand corner of the tab bar.

The Query Tool features two panels:

-   The upper panel displays the SQL Editor. You can use the panel to enter, edit, or execute a query. It also shows the **History** tab, which you can use to view the queries that executed in the session. You can use the scratch pad to hold text snippets during editing.
    
    To reopen a closed scratch pad or open a new one, right-click the SQL Editor and select **Add Panel**. You can also open new scratch pads from other panels using the same technique.
-   The lower panel displays the **Data Output** panel. The tabbed panel displays the result set returned by a query, information about a query's execution plan, server messages related to the query's execution, and any asynchronous notifications received from the server.

**The Query Tool Toolbar**

The **Query Tool** toolbar uses context-sensitive icons that provide shortcuts to frequently performed tasks. If an icon is highlighted, the option is enabled; if the icon is grayed-out, the task is disabled.

Hover over an icon to display a tool-tip that describes the icon's functionality:

## The SQL editor panel

The **SQL editor** panel is a workspace where you can manually provide a query, copy a query from another source, or read a query from a file. The SQL editor features syntax coloring and auto-completion.

![Query Tool - Query Editor tab](images/query_sql_editor.png)

To use auto-complete, begin typing your query; when you would like the Query editor to suggest object names or commands that might be next in your query, press the Control+Space key combination. For example, type `\*SELECT \* FROM\*` (with a trailing space), and then press the Control+Space key combination to select from a popup menu of auto-complete options.

![Query Tool - Query Editor tab](images/query_autocomplete.png)

After entering a query, select **Execute/Refresh** from the toolbar. The database server receives the complete contents of the SQL editor panel for execution. To execute only a section of the code that is displayed in the SQL editor, highlight the text that you want the server to execute, and select **Execute/Refresh**.

![Query Tool - Query Editor tab - Autocomplete feature](images/query_execute_section.png)

The message returned by the server when a command executes is displayed on the **Messages** tab. If the command is successful, the **Messages** tab displays execution details.

![Query Tool - Query Editor - Message tab](images/query_tool_message.png)

Options on the **Edit** menu offer functionality that helps with code formatting and commenting:

-   Use the auto-indent feature to indent text to the same depth as the previous line by pressing the Return key.
-   Block indent text by selecting two or more lines and pressing the Tab key.
-   Implement or remove SQL style or toggle C style comment notation within your code.

You can also drag and drop certain objects from the tree-view to save time spent typing long object names. Text containing the object name are fully qualified with the schema name. Double quotes are added if required. For functions and procedures, the function name along with parameter names are pasted into the Query Tool.

## The Data Output panel

The **Data Output** panel displays data and statistics generated by the most recently executed query.

![Query Tool - Data output tab](images/query_output_data.png)

### Data Output tab

The **Data Output** tab displays the result set of the query in a table format. You can:

-   Select and copy from the displayed result set.
-   Use the **Execute/Refresh** options to retrieve query execution information and set query execution options.
-   Select **Download as CSV** to download the content of the **Data Output** tab as a comma-delimited file.
-   Edit the data in the result set of a `SELECT` query if it is updatable.

A result set is updatable if:

-   All columns are either selected directly from a single table, or they are not actually a table column (for example, the concatenation of two columns). Only columns that are selected directly from the table are editable, other columns are read-only.
-   All the primary key columns or OIDs of the table are selected in the result set.

Any columns that are renamed or selected more than once are also read-only.

!!! Note
    To work with an updatable query result set, you must have psycopg2 driver version 2.8 or above installed.

Editable and read-only columns are identified using pencil and lock icons (respectively) in the column headers.

![Query Tool - Editable and Read-only columns](images/query_tool_editable_columns.png)

An updatable result set is similar to the **Data Grid** in **View/Edit Data** mode and can be modified in the same way.

If Auto-commit is off, data changes are made as part of the ongoing transaction; if no transaction is ongoing, a new one is initiated. The data changes are not committed to the database unless the transaction is committed.

If any errors occur during saving (for example, trying to save a NULL into a column with a NOT NULL constraint), the data changes are rolled back to an automatically created `SAVEPOINT` to ensure any previously executed queries in the ongoing transaction are not rolled back.

All rowsets from previous queries or commands that are displayed in the **Data Output** panel get discarded when you invoke another query; open another query tool browser tab to keep your previous results available.

### Explain tab

To generate the **Explain** or **Explain Analyze** plan of a query, select **Explain** or **Explain Analyze** in the toolbar.

More options related to **Explain** and **Explain Analyze** can be selected from the drop-down menu.

![Query Tool - Toolbar Explain button](images/query_toolbar_explain.png)

Please note that PEM generates the **Explain [Analyze]** plan in JSON format.

On successful generation of **Explain** plan, three tabs/panels generate under the **Explain** panel.

### Graphical tab

To download the plan as an SVG file, select **Download** in the top-left corner of the Explain canvas. **Download as SVG** isn't supported on Internet Explorer.

![Query Tool - Explain tab - Graphical plan tab](images/query_output_explain_details.png)

The query plan that accompanies **Explain analyze** is available on the **Data Output** tab.

### Analysis tab

The **Analysis** tab shows the plan details in table format, generating a format similar to the one available at `explain.depsez.com`. Each row of the table represents the data for an Explain Plan node. The output can contain the node information, exclusive timing, inclusive timing, actual versus planned rows, actual rows, planned rows, or loops. Child rows of the selected row are marked with an orange dot.

If the percentage of the exclusive/inclusive timings of the total query time is:

Greater than 90 --> Red

Greater than 50 --> Orange (between red and yellow)

Greater than 10 --> Yellow

If the planner has misestimated the number of rows (actual vs planned) by:

10 times --> Yellow color

100 times --> Orange (between Red and Yellow) color

1000 times --> Red color

![Query Tool - Explain tab - Analysis tab](images/query_explain_analyze_table.png)

### Statistics tab

The **Statistics** tab displays information in two tables:

-   **Statistics per Node Type** tells you how many times each node type was referenced.
-   **Statistics per Table** tells you how many times each table was referenced by the query.

![Query Tool - Explain plan tab - Statistics tab](images/query_explain_analyze_statistics.png)

### Messages tab

Use the **Messages** tab to view information about the most recently executed query:

![Query Tool - Output error](images/query_output_error.png)

If the server returns an error, the error message appears on the **Messages** tab, and the syntax that caused the error is underlined in the SQL editor. If a query succeeds, the **Messages** tab displays how long the query took to complete and how many rows were retrieved:

![Query Tool - Messages tab](images/query_output_messages.png)

### Notifications tab

Use the **Notifications** tab to view the notifications using the PostgreSQL Listen/Notify feature. For more details, see [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html).

Example:

1.  Execute `LISTEN "foo"` in first Query Tool session.

![Query Tool - notifications listen](images/query_output_notifications_listen.png)

2.  In the another Query Tool session, execute `Notify` command or `pg_notify`
    function to send the notification of the event together with the payload.

![Query Tool - notifications notify](images/query_output_notifications_notify.png)

3.  You can observe the **Notification** tab in the first Query Tool session
    where it shows the Recorded time, Event, Process ID, and the Payload of the
    particular channel.

![Query Tool - Output Notifications panel](images/query_output_notifications_panel.png)

## Query History panel

Use the **Query History** tab to review activity for the current session:

![Query Tool - Query History tab](images/query_output_history.png)

The **Query History** tab displays information about recent commands:

-   The date and time that a query was invoked.
-   The text of the query.
-   The number of rows returned by the query.
-   The amount of time it took the server to process the query and return a result set.
-   Messages returned by the server (not noted on the **Messages** tab).
-   The source of the query (indicated by icons corresponding to the toolbar).

You can show or hide the queries generated internally by pgAdmin (during **View/Edit Data** or **Save Data** operations).

To erase the content of the **Query History** tab, select **Clear history** from the **Clear** drop-down menu.

Query history is maintained across sessions for each database on a per-user basis when running in **Query Tool** mode. In **View/Edit Data** mode, history is not retained. By default, the last 20 queries are stored for each database. This can be adjusted in `config_local.py` by overriding the `MAX_QUERY_HIST_STORED` value.

## Connection status

Use the **Connection status** feature to view the current connection and transaction status by selecting the status in Query Tool:

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_connection_status.png)

## Macros

Query Tool Macros enable you to execute predefined SQL queries by pressing a single key. Predefined queries can contain the placeholder `$SELECTION$`. When the macro executes, the placeholder is replaced with the currently selected text in the **Query Editor** pane of the Query Tool.

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_manage_macros.png)

To create a macro:

1.  In the Query Tool, select **Macros** > **Manage Macros**. 
2.  Select the key you want to use, enter the name of the macro and the query.
3.  Optionally, include the selection placeholder.
4.  Select **Save**. 

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_manage_macros_dialog.png)

To clear a macro, in the Manage Macros dialog box, select the macro and select **Clear**.

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_macros_clear_row.png)

To clear the selected macro, respond **Yes** to the prompt.

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_macros_clear_confirmation.png)

To clear all macros, select **Clear** next to **Key**. Respond **Yes** to the prompt.

![Query Tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_macros_clear_all.png)

To execute a macro, select the shortcut keys, or select it from the **Macros** menu.
