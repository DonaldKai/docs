!!! Tip "New Feature "
    BDR support is available in PEM version 8.1.0 and later.

BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides multi-master replication between the Postgres clusters. Before you monitor BDR through PEM console, you must ensure that your BDR nodes are up and running. For more information, see [BDR](/bdr/latest).

You can configure PEM to display status information about one or more BDR nodes using dashboards in PEM version 8.1.0 and BDR version 3.7.9 and later.

To configure PEM to monitor BDR nodes, use the PEM web client to create a server definition. Use the tabs on the [New Server Registration](/pem/latest/pem_online_help/01_toc_pem_getting_started/07_pem_define_connection/) dialog box to specify general connection properties for the BDR node with the following exceptions:

-   Specify the BDR-enabled database name in the **Database** field of the **PEM Agent** tab.

-   Specify the user having the bdr_monitor or bdr_superuser role in the **username** field of the **PEM Agent** tab.

After saving the server definition, the BDR node is included in the list of servers under the PEM server directory in the PEM client object browser tree. You can monitor the BDR nodes from BDR dashboards.

To include monitoring information on the BDR dashboards, you must enable the relative probes for each BDR group. See the complete list of BDR [probes](monitoring_performance/probes/#bdr-probes).

To enable a probe, right-click the node name, and select **Management > Manage Probes**.

To monitor the BDR Node, right-click the name of the BDR node in the object browser tree. From the **Dashboards** menu, select the BDR Admin, BDR Group Monitoring, or BDR Node Monitoring dashboard.
