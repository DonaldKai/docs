Patroni is among the most popular open-source tools for managing replication and failover of Postgres clusters. It relies on Postgresâ€™s streaming replication and hot standby capabilities. These capabilities allow DBAs to simplify the process of setting up and managing clusters having high availability as well as read-scalability requirements. Patroni is tested by EDB for use with PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

For more information, see the [Patroni documentation](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Supported topology

Patroni supports these high-availability components:

* Postgres cluster &mdash; The database cluster, usually consisting of a primary and two or more replicas.
* Patroni &mdash; The failover management utility.
* etcd &mdash; A distributed configuration store (DCS) containing cluster information such as configuration, health, and current status.
* HAProxy &mdash; A proxy to connect to the read-write and read-only nodes. We strongly suggest this component for avoiding data loss in case of a split-brain. We recommend using two HAProxy nodes for high availability but at least one node with HAProxy. HAProxy on the application node is a good solution as well.

### Postgres

We currently support using only Patroni and Postgres _physical streaming replication_ with a primary server and two replicas (replicating directly from the primary). We support using either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

### Patroni

Install Patroni on the Postgres nodes. We support the [latest release](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases.html#releases).

### Etcd

Etcd is a strongly consistent distributed key-value store. It provides a reliable way to store data that a distributed system or cluster of machines needs to access.

For more information, see the [etcd documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/).

!!! Note
    For production environments, we recommend setting up an etcd cluster of three nodes. One etcd cluster can serve multiple Postgres/Patroni clusters. Intall etcd nodes on different hosts from the Postgres nodes.


See [Etcd](installing_etcd) to install and set up etcd.

### Watchdog

To avoid split-brain situations, Patroni supports [watchdog](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/watchdog.html) devices.

Watchdog devices are software or hardware mechanisms that reset the whole system when they dono't get a keepalive heartbeat within a specified timeframe. This device adds a layer of fail safe in case usual Patroni split-brain protection mechanisms fail.

!!! Note
    While the use of a watchdog mechanism with Patroni is optional, we recommend using it for production environments.


## HAProxy

Instead of connecting directly to the database server, you can set up HAProxy so the application connects to the proxy instead. The proxy then forwards the request to Postgres. When you use HAProxy for this purpose, you can route read-only requests to one or more replicas for load balancing.

You can install HAProxy as an independent server, but you can also install it on the application server or the database server.

!!! Note
    For production environments, we recommend setting up at least two HAProxy servers. Using various ports, one HAProxy server can serve multiple Postgres/Patroni clusters.


## Security considerations

Security considerations are beyond the scope of this documentation. You can find more details about the distributed configuration storage (DCS) and the Patroni REST API in the [Patroni documentation](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html).

You can use HTTPS with HAProxy, which is alsonot covered in this documentation.
