Patroni is among the most popular open-source tools for managing replication and failover of Postgres clusters. It relies on Postgresâ€™s streaming replication and hot standby capabilities allowing DBAs to simplify the process of setting up and managing clusters having high availability as well as read scalability requirements. Patroni is tested by EDB for use with PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
