Patroni is supported on the same Linux x86-64 operating systems supported by [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg) and [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas) as defined on the [Platform Compatibility page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility).

Patroni packages are provided through the PGDG apt and yum repositories.
