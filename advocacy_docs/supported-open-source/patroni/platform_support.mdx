Patroni is supported on the same Linux x86-64 operating systems supported by [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg) and [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas).

Patroni packages are provided through the PGDG apt and yum repositories.

The diagram shows the Patroni architecture with the three etc nodes that are used for DCS.
