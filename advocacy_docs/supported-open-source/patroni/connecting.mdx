## Connection strings

PostgreSQL [client libraries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) like `libpq` and `jdbc` support client connection fail-over. The connection string contains multiple servers (eg: `host=srv1,srv2`) and the client library loops over the available hosts to find a connection that is available and capable of read-write or read-only operations. This capability allows clients to follow the primary cluster during a switchover.

Example:

```bash
$ psql "host=srv1,srv2 dbname=postgres user=admin target_session_attrs=read-write" -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 f
(1 row)

$ psql "host=srv1,srv2 dbname=postgres user=admin target_session_attrs=read-only" -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 t
(1 row)
```

## VIP & Keepalived

When using multiple HAProxy instances and you need a way to decide to which proxy host to connect to, the easiest solution is to use Keepalived and a VIP (virtual IP).

### RHEL8 example

This is an installation and configuration example on RHEL8.

First, install Keepalived on each hosts running HAProxy:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install -y keepalived
$ sudo cp /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.bck
```

For the purpose of this demo, we will use `192.168.121.121` as virtual IP. Configure then Keepalived:

```bash
$ VIP=192.168.121.121
$ MY_IP=$(hostname -I | awk ' {print $1}')
$ DEVICE=$(ip -br address | grep $MY_IP | awk '{print $1}')
$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
global_defs {
  vrrp_garp_master_delay 3
  vrrp_garp_master_repeat 4
  vrrp_garp_master_refresh 60
  vrrp_garp_master_refresh_repeat 4
}
vrrp_instance patroni {
  state BACKUP
  interface $DEVICE
  virtual_router_id 100
  priority 100
  advert_int 1
  virtual_ipaddress {
    $VIP
  }
  authentication {
    auth_type PASS
    auth_pass secret
  }
}
EOF
```

Don't forget to configure the firewall if needed:

```bash
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value="vrrp" accept' --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Finally, enable and start the Keepalived service:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable keepalived
$ sudo systemctl start keepalived
```

Once started, the virtual IP should be attached to one of the hosts. Try to reach it:

```bash
$ ping -c 3 $VIP
