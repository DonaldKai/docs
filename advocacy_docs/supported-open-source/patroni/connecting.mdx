## Connection strings

PostgreSQL [client libraries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) like `libpq` and `jdbc` support client-connection failover. The connection string contains multiple servers, for example, `host=srv1,srv2`. The client library loops over the available hosts to find a connection that's available and capable of read-write or read-only operations. This configuration allows clients to follow the primary cluster during a switchover.

The following examples require you to have `psycopg2` linked to `libpq` library from PostgreSQL 14.

```
$ psql "host=srv1,srv2 dbname=postgres user=admin target_session_attrs=read-write" -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 f
(1 row)

$ psql "host=srv1,srv2 dbname=postgres user=admin target_session_attrs=read-only" -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 t
(1 row)
```

## Using multihost connection strings and HAProxy

When setting up a cluster with two or more HAProxy nodes, a good option is to set up all HAProxy nodes in a multihost connection.

When using HAProxy, read-write and read-only connections are distinguished by the port number they connect to. This approach differs from the [Connection strings](#connection-strings) example, which uses `target_session_attrs` for these cnnections.

Suppose you are using a HAProxy configuration with port 5000 on the HAProxy node routing connections to the primary read-write node and 5001 to the replicas for read-only connections. The configuration of the connection strings for connections to the primary node look llike this:

```
'host=haproxy-node1,haproxy-node2 dbname=postgres user=admin port=5000'
```

Read-only connections have a similar connection string but with a different port number:

```
'host=haproxy-node1,haproxy-node2 dbname=postgres user=admin port=5001'
```

## VIP and Keepalived

When using multiple HAProxy instances and you need a way to decide which proxy host to connect to, the easiest solution is to use Keepalived and a VIP (virtual IP).

### RHEL8 example

This example shows installating and configuring on RHEL8.

First, install Keepalived on each of the hosts running HAProxy:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y keepalived
sudo cp /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.bck
```

For this example, use 192.168.121.121 as the virtual IP. Configure the Keepalived:

```bash
VIP=192.168.121.121
MY_IP=$(hostname -I | awk ' {print $1}')
DEVICE=$(ip -br address | grep $MY_IP | awk '{print $1}')

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
global_defs {
  vrrp_garp_master_delay 3
  vrrp_garp_master_repeat 4
  vrrp_garp_master_refresh 60
  vrrp_garp_master_refresh_repeat 4
}
vrrp_instance patroni {
  state BACKUP
  interface $DEVICE
  virtual_router_id 100
  priority 100
  advert_int 1
  virtual_ipaddress {
    $VIP
  }
  authentication {
    auth_type PASS
    auth_pass secret
  }
}
EOF
```

Configure the firewall if needed:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value="vrrp" accept' --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Enable and start the Keepalived service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable keepalived
sudo systemctl start keepalived
```

Once started, the virtual IP is attached to one of the hosts. To verify, try to reach it:

```
$ ping -c 3 $VIP
