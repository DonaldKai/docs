title: Autocluster
---

The Autocluster TAM trades INSERT performance for better SELECT performance on tables where multiple rows are selected based on an indexed set of columns. This feature is achieved by maintaining rows with the same key values clustered together so that an index scan for a specific key can find all the rows close together and doesn't need to retrieve as many table pages to satisfy the query.
